# ANN_Classification
## Classification of a rectangle from points on a graph

The project was done on University Laboratories. It consist of two parts:

  - **classification of points using analytical method** - calculating weights and biases "by hand" and applying them as a small neural network.

  - **classification of points using Artifficial Neural Network learning** - by modelling a neural network and learning it using predefined points.

Project contains the code, pictures of graphs obtained by analytical and learning method, and calculations used for analytical method

## Running:
The project was run on the Anaconda enviroment, although should run on any Python 3.8 enviroment containing packages:

- tensorflow 2.4.0

- numpy 1.19.2

- matplotlib 3.3.2
